    title: "My Thinkful Journey | Day 1",
    post: "After a bit of research, I finally decided to join a development bootcamp, particularly Thinkful's Full Stack Flex. Just in case you don't know what it is, a coding bootcamp is a technical training program that focuses on teaching skills that the market needs. Bootcamps are generally 2â€“6 months, and are designed to place students into jobs when they graduate. To start, learning something new is going to be all about you. The time you put in and  the drive you have to learn the material will be what makes this program successful for new students. Thinkful or any bootcamp will provide the opportunity if you provide the hard work and dedication. This is what I tell myself. And I think I'm ready for the challenge.",

    post: "I've been a self-taught programmer for many years with dreams of taking my skills and enthusiasm into the progessional setting, so I was excited to find out about Thinkful's Full Stack Flex program. They work with you on a curriculum to give you today's most marketable skills like ReactJS and Node as well as professional coding practices you might not pick up on your own like testing frameworks and using Git. Beyond the curriculum and coding practices they instill, the real power of Thinkful's program is the mentors. You get twice weekly meetings with a mentor who has a successful background in bringing web applications to market. They guide your through tough to understand content, trouble shoot with you while you are stuck and help you build and refine your projects. I looked forward to my meetings with my mentor because he could always help me get unstuck, explain important concepts and clear up misicues with patience and understanding. He also helped keep me accountable and pushed me to try more challenging things and be a better programmer. Additionally, when you aren't working one-on-one with your mentor, you have access to other mentors in multiple daily Q+A sessions on all sorts of topics, live Family Dinner events with students and local mentors/program managers and a Slack channel.",

    post: "I tried to study with tons of free resources out there, but it was too slow and unfocused. Conceptually, with Thinkful you are still learning by yourself, but with one huge difference, there are always either mentors or/and Q&A sessions available for you when you need them. This makes learning process less stressful and demotivating when stuck. This lets you move forward. Thinkful's model is a good fit for those who work full time and also want to learn how to code. Go for it! you won't regret it. The curriculum is well structured. Not only does it offer easy to understand examples in each lesson along the way, but it also increases the complexity of those examples and slowly introduces concepts into the code that you as a student have to go figure out for yourself, which as it turns out is a critical component of surviving in the tech industry.",
